0.1.2 - 2018-09-04
  * Consider 404 responses as valid
  * Set q_mem + q_max_mem stats correctly at startup

0.1.1 - 2017-10-19
  * Fixed one missing case where there was no log output on TCP
    disconnect (reaching the peristence timer during the idle state).
  * All TCP disconnect/reconnect logging is now suppressed by default, but can
    be enabled (even in non-debug builds) with the new "-v" commandline
    argument for "verbose logging".

0.1.0 - 2017-10-15
  * Embedded http-parser from joyent upgraded from 2.1 to 2.7.1
  * The hardcoded limit for PURGEs sent over a single outbound
    connection before we recycle it has increased from 10K to 100K (the
    15-minute limit for the same remains).
  * The maximum wait time between retrying failed purger connect()
    attempts has reduced from 32s to 8s.
  * The purgers never wait to reconnect after a disconnect when their
    queue is idle; they now immediately connect on startup, and always
    reconnect immediately on disconnect.
  * The memory size of queue objects has grown - they're now stored in
    the form of their eventual outbound raw HTTP PURGE request, rather
    than just as the URL (basically, the parsing of URLs and generation
    of HTTP PURGE text has moved upstream of the queueing).
  * Each purger now has its own separate purge queue
  * The purgers' queues are connected serially in the order the purgers
    are specified on the commandline.  The first purger must completely
    process a purge (including http response) before it will forward
    that purge to the queue of the next.
  * Each purger queue has a configurable delay specified in
    floating-point seconds.  The default is 0.0, and the minimum
    non-zero configurable value is 0.1.  Purge requests are forced to
    wait in a purger's queue for this amount of time before being
    forwarded.  For the first purger the time starts on HTCP reception.
    For the remainder, the time starts when they receive a forwarded
    purge from an earlier purger.
  * Better checking of PURGE response parsing errors
  * Stats output (file+syslog) has changed substantially.
  * All failed purges now affect both a stats counter and emit a log
    message.  Previously, some types of failure would just do one and
    not the other.
  * Queue string storage is now managed by malloc rather than a local
    custom storage pool.
  * Queue metadata storage now shrinks after spikes (within reason)
  * libjemalloc is linked and slightly tunedfor improved malloc perf.
  * Substantial internal refactoring/simplification.

0.0.11 - 2016-01-22
  wrapped complex assert funcs in NDEBUG checks to make sure they
    don't affect NDEBUG builds

0.0.10 - 2013-09-09
  Bugfix: was not handling connection close during RECVWAIT
    state on purger connections.

0.0.9 - 2013-08-14
  Limit HTTP purge connections to 15 minutes or 10K requests
    per-connection.  Otherwise they seem to live indefinitely,
    which is bound to eventually trigger a bug in vhtcpd or
    varnish somewhere.
  Added queue_size and queue_max_size stats output.  queue_size
    is the current size at the moment of stats snapshot, whereas
    max tracks the peak value since initialization (even a spike
    between snapshots), and is reset on queue wipe due to overflow.

0.0.8 - 2013-07-02
  Fixed HTTP response parsing bug that caused queue backlog
    and constant re-send of a certain queue item.
  Added an "inpkts_dequeued" stat, which advances when
    all purgers have dequeued a given request.

0.0.7 - 2013-07-02
  Handles large HTTP response bodies more gracefully
  Small socket tweak for ephemeral port allocation, maybe

0.0.6 - 2013-05-30
  Now allows text hostnames in cache cmdline args
  Upgraded hostname regex matches from POSIX ERE to PCRE
  Fixed a couple of minor memory management bugs that
    happened to not be causing any real problems, at
    least in the build environment being tested.

0.0.5 - 2013-05-29
  First seemingly production-ready release, will track
   significant changes in this file from here out.
